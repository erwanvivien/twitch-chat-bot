# Twitch-chat-bot (Python)

A default bot to read messages from any twitch chat and reply (or not) via IRC

All the code is commented to help understanding each usage

This project has come to an end since I now need to use windows API.
see [next project](https://github.com/erwanvivien/twitch-chat-bot-dotnet) if you are interested in more twitch chat related projects.
